## KidneyInCHRIS part of TrainCKDis Horizon 2020 EU Project
Genetic determinants of Kidney function in The **C**orporative **H**ealth **R**esearch **I**n **S**outh Tyrol (CHRIS) study

Several issues have been created to track the progress in the project.


- List of the issues in chronological order:

1. Picking the discovery Loci
2. Subtracting CHRIS 5K from CKDGen Meta-GWAS
3. Phenotype creation
4. Mapping phenotype to genotypes via GWAS
5. Comparing replicated variants effect magnitude with discovery studies
6. Comparing the 147 CKDGen Loci in CHRIS
7. Excluding batch effects using transformation
8. Phenome-wide mediation analysis
9. Kidney interaction with Thyroid function
10. Sensitivity Analyses
11. Interrogating 163 replicated SNPs in Phenoscanner
